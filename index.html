        The Wallop Vintage Gathering is a non-profit event held annually on the Sunday before the late August bank holiday Monday at the Over Wallop sports field accessible from Salisbury Lane. We welcome anyone wanting a day out with the family hunting a bargain in the car boot, as well as vintage enthusiasts.
        All proceeds from the event go to local charities. This event has most recently helped to raise money for a defibrillator in the town hall, as well as donating money to local charities and groups.

        The next vintage gathering and car boot sale will be held Sunday the 25th August 2018 between 10am and 4pm. We welcome day visitors to this free show, but we would request that you make a donation to the value of your enjoyment.
        Stubble field car parking will be available, sign posted, and accessed from Salisbury Lane; volunteer parking stewards on the day will be able to assist with parking. Please take care when driving on the fields and respect local residents upon arrival and departure.
